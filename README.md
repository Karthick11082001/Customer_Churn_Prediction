Churn Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts customer churn using a Random Forest classifier. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a product or service.

Usage
To use this model, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the churn_prediction.py script.
Provide the required information for a new customer, such as age, subscription length, monthly bill amount, total usage, interaction feature value, monthly usage rate, gender, and location code.
The script will use the trained model to predict whether the customer is likely to churn or not.
Saving and Loading the Model
You can save the trained Random Forest model using the save_model.py script. Similarly, you can load a saved model and use it for predictions with the load_model.py script.

Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have any improvements or additions, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
